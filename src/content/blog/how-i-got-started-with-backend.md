## Overview

The School Chatbot project is a virtual assistant designed to help students, parents, and staff easily access information about the school. Built using Chatfuel, this chatbot simplifies communication, provides answers to frequently asked questions, and offers support to users at any time.

## Key Features

### 1. Information Access:

The chatbot provides information about school schedules, holidays, and important announcements. Users can quickly get details about upcoming events, exam dates, or general school policies, eliminating the need to search for these details manually.

### 2. FAQs Handling:

The chatbot is capable of answering frequently asked questions such as “What are the admission requirements?” or “How do I contact the administration?” This feature helps reduce the workload for school staff and ensures that users get consistent, prompt answers to their queries.

### 3. Interactive User Experience:

By using Chatfuel, the chatbot offers an interactive and user-friendly experience with buttons and quick replies, making it easy for users to navigate through various topics. Whether it’s checking school timings or accessing contact information, users can quickly tap on the available options to get what they need.

### 4. Multi-Lingual Support:

The chatbot can support multiple languages, making it accessible to a diverse user base, including non-native speakers who may be part of the school community. This is particularly useful in schools with students and families from different backgrounds.
